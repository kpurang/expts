Having served as the Queen of Thebes for many years, she believes herself to be well aware of the events surrounding her first-born son\\u2019s death, Laius\\u2019s murder, and Oedipus\\u2019s ascension to the throne. She initially appears as a mediator between Oedipus and Creon as the two argue over Tiresias\\u2019s visions, and she tries to convince her husband to dismiss the prophecies by telling him the story of an oracle that wrongly predicted Laius\\u2019s murder at the hands of his son. Jocasta speaks with a confident attitude in this moment, one which highlights her belief in the power of human behavior over the will of the gods. Even as Oedipus explains to her that he too received a similar prophecy stating that he would kill his father and marry his mother, she maintains that nothing can be predicted and tells him not to worry. This behavior reveals her hubris and suggests that from her position of authority, she feels protected from the tales that others tell about her fate.\",\n",

Laius wished to thwart the prophecy, so he sent a shepherd-servant to leave Oedipus to die on a mountainside. However, the shepherd took pity on the baby and passed him to another shepherd who gave Oedipus to King Polybus and Queen Merope to raise as their own. Oedipus learned from the oracle at Delphi of the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother but, unaware of his true parentage, believed he was fated to murder Polybus and marry Merope, and so he left for Thebes. On his way, he met an older man and killed him in a quarrel. Continuing on to Thebes, he found that the king of the city (Laius) had recently been killed and that the city was at the mercy of the Sphinx. Oedipus answered the monster's riddle correctly, defeating it and winning the throne of the dead king \\u2013 and the hand in marriage of the king's widow, who was also (unbeknownst to him) his mother Jocasta.\",\n",
