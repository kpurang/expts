This is a simple chat that helps users explore their thoughts by asking questions and offering differnet perspectives. 

It was anticipated that this would require analyzing the user's turns to find the kind of response we would need to provide. However, it turns out that chatGPT is quite good at doing this out of the box, so all that is needed is a simple instruction.

We would be able to guide the conversation better with the original plan, but this is interesting as it is.

The scripts are just a loop over user input and chatgpt response presented in a simple html form.
