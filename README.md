Here are some fun little experiments.

## Done

These are some version 0 prototypes.

- fakeGen
  - generates plausible false statements using triviaQA and chatGPT
- factCheck
  - deciding whether statements are true or false.


## Todo

Some day.

- LLM as KB. We know LLMs are not good at reasoning and are not good at distinguishing true from false statements. To what extent can we use the information contained in them though?
- LLMs as conversation analyzers. LLM based chat agents are good at conversation analysis. Can that be made explicit?
