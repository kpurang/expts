    "# Using PaLM to generate false statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to generate a set of true and false statements to test fact-checking approaches. We need interesting statements and the false statements need to be plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the true statements we use [TriviaQA](http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/) which is a dataset of questions and answers that is meant for reading comprehension and question answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate true and false statements, we use PaLM to 1. combine the question and answer into a statement 2. generate a fake answer similar to the true answer (assume the true answer is unique and not equivalent to the fake one) 3. combine the question and fake answer into a false statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference with the chatGPT version\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that PaLM does not always produce well formed JSON. For instance, \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "'[{\"question\": \"Which Lloyd Webber musical premiered in the US on 10th December 1993?\", \"answer\": \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"statement\": \"Sunset Boulevard premiered in the US on 10th December 1993.\", \"fake_answer\": \"Cats\", \"fake_statement\": \"Cats premiered in the US on 10th December 1993.\"}]}'\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "There is an extra '}' at the end of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "I then requested that it generate labeled newline separated text like:\n",

    "'Question: In the very first Boston Marathon, 15 runners competed. How many finished?\\nAnswer: eighty-five thousand  distance\\n\\nStatement: The very first Boston Marathon had eighty-five thousand runners.\\nFake answer: 15\\nFake statement: The very first Boston Marathon had 15 runners.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the labels are not always as requested, and not all labels are always present. \n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors of PaLM have to be handled in the script.\n"
