    "# Fact checking with web search and LLMs for inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a statement, verify whether it is true or not. We want a final answer but also supporting and contradictory evidence for that answer for better explainability. When LLMs are asked for evidence, they tend to make up reasons and especially the source of evidence. It seems that the LLMs decide on the answer then look for things that look like evidence. The great majority of URLs generated by both chatGPT and PaLM for that purpose are non-existent or irrelevant. Fact checking with web search generates real text snippets that support or contradict the statement as well as their source. This is evidence that can be easily verified. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach does it by:\n",
    "1. web search to find relevant web pages\n",
    "2. comparing embeddings to find relevant passages in the web pages\n",
    "3. using a LLM to verify whether the statement follows from the text\n",
    "4. getting a result out of the inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main resources used are:\n",
    "- bing search api for web search\n",
    "- trafilatura for extracting useful text\n",
    "- langchain for various utilities and pipelining\n",
    "- OpenAI and Google PaLM for LLMs\n",
    "- ChromaDb for vector store\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach depends on the answer begin available on the web in chunks of text. However that may not always be the case. You sometimes need to search for multiple pieces of evidence and combine them to infer the statemnt (or its negation) This is handled in the next version.\n"
